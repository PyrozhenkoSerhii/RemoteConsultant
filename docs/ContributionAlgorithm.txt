=== Algrorithm
To determine the contribution of the consultant, we choose the method of weighting coefficients
We have following criterias that can add or subtract value to the total score [from; to]:
> The opinion of the consultant was decisive in the purchase of this product [+0%; +30%]
> Consultant competency (1-5 points, set by user) [-10%; +10%]
> Consultant friendliness (1-5 points, set by user) [-10%; +10%]
> Consultant suggest alternative product that was bought by the customer [0; +15%]
> Number of consultations in comparison with others	[0; +10%]
> Number of participations for sale in comparison with others [0; +10%]
> Total consultants rating [-10%; +10%]
> Number of hours online [0; +5%]
The amount of reward each consultant will get is in direct proportion 
to the points earned by consultant (from 0 to 100) and depends on the sum of points 
earned by all consultants.
